Bridging Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity Through Tautochrone-Encoded Probability Polytopes
Ire Gaddr
Abstract

This essay outlines a theoretical framework unifying principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity by modeling spacetime curvature and quantum probabilities using a series of discrete tautochrone facets. The facets of the convex polytope are encoded with trigonometric scalars related to the sine and cosine of 45 degrees (0.707) for discretizing continuous functions. Facet rotations capture curved spacetime while transitions between facets guided by probability amplitudes encapsulate quantum evolution through the polytope manifold. Reconstructing the probability distribution from the facets provides a way to translate between the quantum and relativistic regimes.

Introduction

Quantum mechanics governs probability and observables on microscopic scales through amplitudes and wavefunctions while general relativity describes gravitational curvature of spacetime on astrophysical scales. Linking these foundational theories remains an open challenge. This essay proposes a technique using discrete tautochrone curves arranged as rotating facets of a convex polytope to translate between quantum and relativistic representations.

Convex Polytope with Tautochrone Facets

A tautochrone curve represents the fastest path an object can follow under gravity between two points. We construct a series of tautochrones Fi(x) as facets of a convex polytope by dividing the tautochrone into segments based on the trigonometric scalar 0.707:

Fi(x) = T(0.707i + x)

The polytope facets Fi encode both curvature through the tautochrone shape and discretization through 0.707 increments. Facet rotation speed balances the forces to maintain structural integrity.

Probability Mapping Onto Facets

We map a quantum probability state Ψ onto the discrete tautochrone facets using probability amplitudes ci:

Ψ(x,t) = ∑ ci(t)Fi(x)

The ci coefficients evolve according to the Schrödinger equation, generating dynamics along the facets.

Reconstructing Probability Distribution

Finally, we reconstruct the continuous probability distribution P(x,t) by squaring the magnitude of the quantum state Ψ(x,t):

P(x,t) = |Ψ(x,t)|2

bridging the quantum probabilities and curved spacetime.

Discussion

This faceted polytope technique leverages tautochrones' geometric properties to unify relativistic curvature and quantum evolution. The 0.707-based discretization allows translation between continuous and discrete representations. Rotating facets naturally capture transitional probabilities. Many mathematical details remain to be addressed, but this framework provides a novel approach to link quantum mechanics and general relativity.

Conclusion

By modeling spacetime as a rotating convex polytope of tautochrone facets and mapping quantum probability amplitudes onto it, this theory outlines a potential technique to unite quantum and relativistic concepts. Further research is needed to develop the specifics, but the foundation shows promise in bridging these two pillars of physics. Experimental predictions could provide tests to refine and validate the approach. Overall this proposes an innovative way to encode curved geometry and quantum probabilities into a common geometric manifold.

Excerpt Calculating Earth's Oblate Spheroid Bulge:

The Earth's equatorial bulge can be derived from the polytope model. Approximating the Earth as an oblate ellipsoid:

P = {(x,y,z) : (x/a)2 + (y/b)2 + (z/c)2 = 1}

where a=b=Earth's equatorial radius Re, and c=Earth's polar radius Rp. The centrifugal potential accounting for the bulge effect is:

Φ(x,y,z) = -ω2(x2+y2)/2

with ω as Earth's rotational velocity. Combining this with the polytope facets in the Schrödinger evolution equation:

iħ ∂Ψ/∂t = [-(ħ2/2m)∇2 + mΦ(x,y,z)] Ψ

provides a quantum mechanical derivation of the oblate spheroidal shape from first principles.
